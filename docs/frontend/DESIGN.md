# ChatGPT — Style Reference
> graphite ink on warm paper

**Theme:** light

ChatGPT uses a graphite-on-paper language: near-white canvas (#f9f9f9 sidebar) with the main conversation surface staying white, near-black ink for all primary text and icons, and zero chromatic accents. The entire UI is achromatic — meaning is carried by weight (600 headings, 400 body, 500 for emphasis) and spatial rhythm rather than color. Surfaces stay flat; elevation comes from a single hairline border at 1px rgba(0,0,0,0.05) rather than shadow. Controls are small, square-ish (10px radius), and chrome-light so the written response dominates. The system reads as restrained utility software — every pixel earns its place.

## Colors

| Name | Value | Role |
|------|-------|------|
| Sidebar Mist | `#f9f9f9` | Sidebar and secondary surface backgrounds — page chrome recedes behind the conversation |
| Pure White | `#ffffff` | Main canvas and elevated surface — primary reading area, elevated panels, inverted text backgrounds |
| Graphite Ink | `#0d0d0d` | Primary headings, body text, and icon fills on light surfaces. Do not promote it to the primary CTA color |
| Mid Ash | `#5d5d5d` | Secondary text and icons — supporting labels, metadata |
| Hollow | `#8f8f8f` | Tertiary text, disabled states, muted helper copy |
| Hairline | `#0000001a` | 1px borders and dividers — rgba black at ~10% opacity, the sole structural separator |
| Hover Veil | `#0000000d` | Supporting palette color for small decorative accents when the core palette needs contrast. Do not promote it to the primary CTA color |
| Ink Press | `#000000` | Pressed/inverted surface fill, tooltips, scrim — true black for max contrast moments |
| Deep Charcoal | `#00000080` | Modal scrim overlay — 50% black behind dialogs and drawers |
| Edge Gray | `#e6e6e6` | Stronger divider or inactive surface — used sparingly as a higher-contrast border alternative |

## Typography

### -apple-system-body — System UI font — the entire interface renders in -apple-system / BlinkMacSystemFont / Segoe UI, inheriting the OS typeface rather than shipping a custom face. This is a deliberate utility choice: zero font load, native rendering, automatic dark-mode adaptation on macOS/iOS. Body copy sits at 16px/1.5, fine print at 14px/1.43. The 24px/600 step is the sole display tier, reserved for welcome headings — never stretched for marketing drama.

## Components

### Sidebar Item (Ghost Button)
**Role:** Navigation row in the left rail

Transparent background, Graphite Ink (#0d0d0d) text and icon, 10px border-radius, 6px vertical padding, 10px horizontal padding. On hover: fills with Hover Veil (#0000000d). No active state color — active is implied by position or a subtle background tint.

### Compact Icon Button
**Role:** Toolbar action (new chat, search, images)

Transparent fill, 10px radius, 6px vertical / 8px horizontal padding, Graphite Ink icon at 16px. Behaves as the sidebar item but tighter. Hover wash via #0000000d.

### Pill Primary Button (Log In)
**Role:** Account entry action at the bottom of the sidebar

Pure White (#ffffff) fill, Graphite Ink (#0d0d0d) text, 1px Hairline (#0000001a) border, fully rounded radius (16777272px → effectively pill), 0px vertical / 16px horizontal padding. Weight 500 at 14px. The only border-bearing control on the page.

### Sidebar Footer Block
**Role:** Tail stack of links and CTA at sidebar bottom

Hollow vertical stack with no background, 10px row-gap, Hairline (#0000001a) top divider at 1px separating it from the chat list.

### Helper Text Block
**Role:** Body-sm description under a link in the sidebar footer

Hollow (#8f8f8f) 12-14px regular text, line-height 1.43, no background, acts as secondary helper copy next to a primary action.

### Conversation Card
**Role:** Recent chat row in the sidebar list

Transparent default with 10px radius and 6px vertical padding. On hover: #0000000d wash. Title in Graphite Ink at 14px/500 weight; preview in Hollow at 13px.

### Hairline Divider
**Role:** Section separator

1px solid Hairline (#0000001a). The only structural divider in the system — no double rules, no shadows.

### Surface Card (Elevated Panel)
**Role:** Floating panel or popover

Pure White (#ffffff) background, 10px radius, 1px Hairline border. Elevation is expressed by border, not shadow. Matches the elevation token #ffffff.

### Tooltip
**Role:** Hover label on icon buttons

Ink Press (#000000) fill, white text, small radius. Uses the --bg-tooltip token. Compact, no arrow ornamentation visible.

### Scrim Overlay
**Role:** Modal backdrop

Deep Charcoal (#00000080) at 50% opacity. Single-layer, no blur.

### Badge / Chip
**Role:** Tag or status indicator

Sidebar Mist (#f9f9f9) background, Graphite Ink text, 0px radius (square corners — a deliberate break from the 10px button radius), no padding wrapper. Used for low-prominence labels.

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do
- Use Graphite Ink (#0d0d0d) for all primary text and icons — never pure #000 for body text; reserve #000 for pressed states, tooltips, and scrims.
- Set element gap to 6px and section gap to 24px; rhythm comes from consistent 6/10/16/24 increments, not arbitrary spacing.
- Keep the entire interface achromatic — no brand blue, no green status, no red error. State changes are communicated by weight, fill veil, and position, not hue.
- Use 10px border-radius for all buttons, sidebar items, and cards. Only the Log In CTA breaks the system with a full pill radius.
- Render all text in the system font stack (-apple-system, system-ui, BlinkMacSystemFont). Do not load custom webfonts.
- Express elevation with a 1px Hairline border (#0000001a), never with box-shadow. The system is flat by conviction.
- Use #0000000d (5% black veil) for every hover state — the interface breathes, it does not flash.

### Don't
- Do not introduce any chromatic accent color — the UI is intentionally grayscale and adding a brand hue breaks the signal that color = data, never decoration.
- Do not use shadows for elevation. Hairline borders only; shadows make a flat utility interface feel ornamental.
- Do not set button text or icons to pure #000000; use #0d0d0d for softer 18.5:1 contrast. Pure black belongs only on inverted surfaces.
- Do not mix pill radii and 10px radii within the same control group — pick one radius per control type and stay consistent.
- Do not use text larger than 24px anywhere in the UI; the display tier is intentionally modest to keep the interface conversational, not promotional.
- Do not add background fills to navigation rows in their default state — chrome should recede until hovered.
- Do not load custom webfonts; the system font is a load-time and a11y advantage, not a compromise.

## Elevation

Elevation is expressed exclusively through 1px hairline borders (#0000001a) on white surfaces, never through drop shadows. The interface is flat by conviction: shadows would make a utility product feel ornamental and would compete with the conversation text that is the actual product. The only exception is the tooltip, which uses a true black fill (#000) to invert against the light surface.

## Surfaces

- **Sidebar Canvas** (`#f9f9f9`) — Left rail background, sets off the main conversation area
- **Conversation Canvas** (`#ffffff`) — Main reading and writing surface where the chat thread lives
- **Elevated Panel** (`#ffffff`) — Popovers, menus, and floating UI — same white but bordered with hairline to lift above the canvas

## Imagery

No photography, no illustrations, no product screenshots. The interface is pure UI — iconography is monochrome line icons (16px, 1.5px stroke implied by nav/fill count), icons-only visual language. No decorative imagery occupies space; the conversation text and user-generated content are the only visual content. Avatar circles for user/assistant messages are minimal solid fills. Density is text-dominant — the interface exists to frame text.

## Layout

Two-column shell: a fixed-width sidebar (260-280px) on the left with a 52px header strip (model selector + account) and a scrollable chat history, and a flexible main column that hosts the conversation thread with a generous max-width of ~720-768px centered horizontally for reading comfort. The hero is implicit — the first screen shows the welcome state (24px/600 headline, helper copy, login CTA stacked in the lower-left of the sidebar). Vertical rhythm uses 24px section gaps and 6px element gaps. No alternating dark/light bands — the entire page is a single light surface with one sidebar accent. Navigation is a minimal vertical list with no top-bar global nav; the brand is absent from the viewport chrome.

## Similar Brands

- **Linear** — Same achromatic-by-default philosophy with a single subtle background tint for the sidebar; relies on hairline borders and weight rather than color to communicate hierarchy
- **Notion** — Near-identical system font usage, 10-12px radius on controls, grayscale-only interface where the document content provides all visual interest
- **Vercel** — Minimal utility UI with hairline 1px borders instead of shadows, system fonts, and zero chromatic accents in the chrome
- **Things 3 (Cultured Code)** — Quiet grayscale sidebar + white main surface, restrained typographic scale, and structural separation through dividers rather than elevation
